# COVID-19-CLASSIFICATION-FROM-CHEST-X-RAY-IMAGES

covid-19 classification from chest x ray images using convolutional neural networks
**INTRODUCTION**
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); in response to the rapidly increasing number of cases of
the emerging disease, this Analysis attempts to provide a comprehensive review of
the Covid-19 Virus. We hope that this Analysis helps in understanding and taking
some precautions of the disease as the Analysis provides the significant symptoms
of COVID-19 and what age groups are mostly getting affected and Analysis on the
number of cases through a period for each state. So, in this particular situation, one
primary thing that needs to be done is manual testing, so that the actual situation
can be understood and appropriate decisions can be taken. But the drawbacks of
manual testing include the availability of testing kits, which are costly and inefficient
blood tests; a blood test takes hours to generate the result.
So, the idea is to overcome these limitations using the Deep Learning technique for
efficient treatment. The faster we produce the results, the fewer cases in the city,
thatâ€™s why we can use CNN to get our job done
